### Overview

This repository contains implementations of popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as personal learning exercises.

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) for neural network implementations.
